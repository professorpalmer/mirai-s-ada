"""Built-in code interpreter for the Bonsai server: an OpenAI-compatible proxy in front of llama-server.

  client --> layer (public port) --> llama-server (127.0.0.1, inner port)

For /v1/chat/completions requests the proxy offers the model a `run_python` tool. When the model calls it,
the proxy runs the code in CPython-on-WASI (layer/wasi-python/sandbox.py: no host files, no network, no
processes, memory and time capped), appends the result, and asks the model again, until the model answers or
calls one of the client's own tools. The client sees one ordinary response.

  - default: on for requests WITHOUT client tools, off (pure passthrough) for requests that bring their own tools
    (E4: with client tools the model retypes paginated tool data into code and transcription errors cost tasks)
  - per request: "code_interpreter": true / false overrides the default
  - with the interpreter on and client tools present, client tool calls are returned as usual
  - the model's reasoning is kept on the internal turns (the server's template renders it)
  - the internal transcript is attached as "interpreter_trace" (runs, exit codes) for auditing
  - streaming requests get the same loop: reasoning and answer tokens are relayed as they arrive, the
    run_python calls are withheld and executed, and the stream continues with the next round
Everything else (other paths, auth header) is forwarded verbatim.
